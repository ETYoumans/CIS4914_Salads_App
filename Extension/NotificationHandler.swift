Objectives:
- Send push notifications when called
    - Check user settings before sending
    - Ensure requirements are met
- Handle interactions between the app and the extension
    - Primarily on/off toggling and settings changes 

Notes: Use assertions to verify assumptions in the code, such as input validation
