    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re building an iOS app that uses a Packet Tunnel VPN extension to capture all network traffic on the device, log useful metadata, and analyze it with a machine learning model to detect location-sharing services. The extension will handle traffic interception, buffering, and log rotation, while the host app manages VPN control, feature extraction, and Core ML inference. To make this work, we’ll cover project setup and entitlements, implementing the packet tunnel, designing buffers and file logging, and setting up communication between the extension and the app. We’ll also go through how to extract meaningful features from packet metadata and how to integrate an ML model for classification. Finally, we’ll discuss testing strategies and common pitfalls so the system works reliably without breaking device connectivity.\n"
